*** 0.14 Tue 21 Oct 2008 <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	- Makefile.PL added wrong META.yml

*** 0.13 Tue 21 Oct 2008 <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	- examples/sccs2git-r was not in MANIFEST
	- provides in META.yml was wrong

*** 0.12 Tue 21 Oct 2008 <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	- Pod fixes
	- $sccs->file () should return file name without sub-folder
	- added examples/sccs2git-r : recursive collect SCCS repos into
	  a single GIT repo

*** 0.11 Wed 02 Jan 2008 <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	- Update copyrights to 2008
	- Tested under perl-5.10.0
	- Added the prereq's to Makefile.PL

*** 0.10 Wed 05 Dec 2007 <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	- examples/sccs2git-gfi uses git-fast-import (Sam Vilain)
	- examples/sccs2git-add uses a file-by file approach
	- win32 has strange ways of dealing with /dev/null^WFile::Spec->devnull ()
	- Module itself now also under git :)

*** 0.09 Mon 03 Dec 2007 <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	- Found a "R" delta to test
	- Checked a complete SCCS tree
	- examples/sccs2git now applies in original order accross files and
	  adds most usefull info from sccs
	- More translate work

*** 0.08 Mon 03 Dec 2007 <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	- /dev/null unknown on braindead OS's, skip to File::Spec->devnull ()
	  . Does MSWin support SCCS at all?
	- make dist now automatically makes a tgz, so I don't have to move
	  it to .tgz
	- moved SCCS files to files/SCCS/ for a better reflection of the truth
	  and preparation of conversion tests
	- examples/sccs2git actually works now! Let's rock ...

*** 0.07 Mon 03 Dec 2007 <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	- Test suite assumed chmod 0000, file to work on windows and cygwin
	- Added docs for SCCS keywords

	- In testing 0.03, I accidentally remove the requirement for 5.006
	- Lifted the 5.8 requirement in README

*** 0.04 Fri 30 Nov 2007 <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	- Remove the last remains of the needless refs to Dynaloader
	- I'm sure I removed that defined-or before. Anyway, 5.006 is back

*** 0.03 Thu 29 Nov 2007 <h.m.brand@xs4all.nl>

	- Require perl-5.8. 5.6.2 fails, and I have no idea why
	  Chickening out, but I have no tuits to find out

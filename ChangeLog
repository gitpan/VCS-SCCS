	- /dev/null unknown on braindead OS's, skip to File::Spec->devnull ()
	  . Does MSWin support SCCS at all?
	- make dist now automatically makes a tgz, so I don't have to move
	  it to .tgz
	- moved SCCS files to files/SCCS/ for a better reflection of the truth
	  and preparation of conversion tests
	- examples/sccs2git actually works now! Let's rock ...

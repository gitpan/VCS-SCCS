      An SCCS file is an ASCII file consisting of six logical parts:

           [4mchecksum[24m       Sum of all characters in the file except the first
                          line.
           [4mdelta[24m [4mtable[24m    Contains information about each delta.
           [4muser[24m [4mnames[24m     Login names and/or numerical group IDs of users
                          who are allowed to add deltas.
           [4mflags[24m          Definitions of internal keywords.  [4mcomments[0m
                          Arbitrary descriptive information about the file.
           [4mbody[24m           Actual text lines intermixed with control lines.

      Throughout an SCCS file there are lines beginning with the ASCII SOH
      (start of heading) character (octal 001).  This character is hereafter
      referred to as the [1mcontrol character [22mand is represented graphically as
      [1m@[22m.  Any line described below that is not depicted as beginning with
      the control character is prevented from beginning with the control
      character.  All lines in the SCCS file are limited to [1mBUFSIZ [22m(defined
      in <[1mstdio.h[22m>) characters in length.

      Entries of the form [4mDDDDD[24m represent a five‚Äêdigit string (a number
      between 00000 and 99999).

      The following describes each logical part of an SCCS file detail:

           [4mChecksum[0m
                The checksum is the first line of an SCCS file.  The form of
                the line is:

                     [1m@h[4m[22mDDDDD[0m

                The value of the checksum is the sum of all characters
                except those in the first line.  The [1m@h [22msequence provides a
                [1mmagic number [22mconsisting of the two bytes 0x01 and 0x68.
                (Other versions of UNIX‚Äêlike operating systems usually use
                this same value but it may be displayed or documented as a
                single number with a different byte order.)

           [4mDelta[24m [4mtable[0m
                The delta table consists of a variable number of entries of
                the form:

                The first line ([1m@s[22m) contains the number of lines
                inserted/deleted/unchanged, respectively.  The second line
                ([1m@d[22m) contains the type of the delta (currently, normal: [1mD[22m,
                and removed: [1mR[22m), the [4mSID[24m (SCCS ID) of the delta, the date

                corresponding to the real user ID at the time the delta was
                created, and the serial numbers of the delta and its
                predecessor, respectively.

                The [1m@i[22m, [1m@x[22m, and [1m@g [22mlines contain the serial numbers of

                The [1m@m [22mlines (optional) each contain one MR (modification
                request) number associated with the delta; the [1m@c [22mlines

                     [1mt    [22mDefines the replacement for the [1m%Y% [22midentification
                          keyword.

                     [1mv    [22mControls prompting for MR numbers in addition to
                          comments.  If the optional text is present, it
                          defines an MR number‚Äêvalidity checking program.

                     [1mi    [22mControls the warning/error aspect of the ‚Äò‚ÄòNo id
                          keywords‚Äô‚Äô message.  When the [1mi [22mflag is not
                          present, the message is only a warning; when the [1mi[0m
                          flag is present, this message causes a fatal error
                          (a [4mget[24m on the file fails, or the delta is not
                          made).

                     [1mb    [22mWhen the [1mb [22mflag is present, the [1m‚àíb [22mkeyletter can
                          be used on the [4mget[24m command to cause a branch in
                          the delta tree.

                     [1mm    [22mDefines the first choice for the replacement text
                          of the [1m%M% [22midentification keyword.

                     [1mf    [22mDefines the ‚Äò‚Äòfloor‚Äô‚Äô release; the release below
                          which no deltas can be added.

                     [1mc    [22mDefines the ‚Äò‚Äòceiling‚Äô‚Äô release; the release above
                          which no deltas can be added.

                     [1md    [22mDefines the default SID to be used when none is
                          specified on a [4mget[24m command.

                     [1mn    [22mCauses [4mdelta[24m to insert a ‚Äò‚Äònull‚Äô‚Äô delta (a delta
                          that applies [4mno[24m changes) in those releases that
                          are skipped when a delta is made in a [4mnew[24m release
                          (such as, when delta 5.1 is made after delta 2.7,
                          releases 3 and 4 are skipped).  The absence of the
                          [1mn [22mflag causes skipped releases to be completely
                          empty.

                     [1mj    [22mCauses [4mget[24m to allow concurrent edits of the same
                          base SID.  See [4madmin[24m(1) for restrictions.

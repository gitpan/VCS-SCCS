VCS::SCCS
    An attempt to convert SCCS files to something more modern

DESCRIPTION
    SCCS (Source Code Control System) is a historical and maybe even
    obsolete VCS (Version Control System).

    This interface aims at the possibility to read those files,
    without the need of the sccs utility set, and open up to the
    possibility of scripts that use it to convert to more modern
    VCSs like git, Mercurial, or subversion.

PREREQUISITES
    perl-5.6.x

    Tested on our own repositories with perl version 5.6.2, 5.8.x-dor
    and 5.10.0. 

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION
    As all CPAN modules:
	# perl Makefile.PL
	# make test
	# make install

    See ChangeLog
